Simplexity is a minimalistic theme for Jekyll. It is meant to showcase your content, using a monochrome color scheme and
a fluid and responsive design. Large, legible fonts scale well across devices and various viewport sizes.

##What is Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms `markdown` file into Html. It plays really nice with GitHub and you
can host your Jekyll powered blog right out of Git pages.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. If you have questions, you can ask them on
[Jekyllâ€™s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
