Simplexity is build with the help of the following open source tools and libraries:

- [Jekyll][jekyll] - great static site generator with some great feature
- [Basscss][basscss] - a great low level CSS toolkit
- [Node.js][node] - I think when they said 'Java everywhere' they really meant Javascript
- [gulp.js][gulp] - task runner with nice slick API and great streaming features
- [Fontawesome][fontawesome] - glyphs and icons, as the name says pretty awesome

Many thank to all those who contributed to these awesome projects!

Simplexity has been inspired by [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com), a great Jekyll theme by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com/) (@4lpine). 
Many thanks for the inspiration!
