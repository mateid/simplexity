###About Simplexity

Simplexity is a minimalistic theme for Jekyll. It is meant to showcase your content, using a monochrome color scheme and a fluid and responsive design. Large, legible fonts scale well across devices and various viewport sizes.

###Getting started

To get started you need to install Jekyll first. When you're done clone the Simplexity Git repo and drop into a command line then type `jekyll serve`. You should be able to see your site at http://0.0.0.0:4000.

###Customize the theme

You can easily customize Simplexity by adding your custom styles to `basscss.css`. It supports easily customizing the fonts via `basscss` variables. You can customize these in the `basscss/basscss.css` file, along with the custom media queries used to scale the font size based on the device viewport. I've kept custom styles to a minimum.
